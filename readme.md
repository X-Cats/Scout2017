# Scout2017

This repository contains all of the code written for scouting during the 2017 FRC season by FRC Team 191 The X-Cats. The system is broken down into three parts;

* **2017Scouting:** This folder contains all of the code written for the pit scouting and data import backend
* **MatchScoutApp:** This folder contains all of the code written to be used in the stands for scouting individual matches.
* **ScoutingAnalyzer:** This folder contains all of the code written for data analysis including the recency bias algorithm.

To use the code several things are going to be required on top of the elements in the repository. A postgresql database is used to store data for each event, thus one will need to be installed to use the system in a competition situation.
